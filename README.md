# Surrogate-assisted Bayesian calibration


***
This repository contains the developed work for a Master's Thesis titled "Spatially Explicit, Depth-dependent and
Data-driven Roughness Calibration for
Numerical Modelling".
***

##Aim:
The main purpose of this repository is to exhibit the workflow of adapting Ferguson's approach in catagorised roughness 
zones of a hydrodynamic numerical model for the Lower Yuba River in Telemac-2D and calibrate the model using 
surrogate-assisted Bayesian inversion process.
